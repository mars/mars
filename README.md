### There's nothing like making things

Making things work, gracefully, repeatably, or at-all 🥵, considering other perspectives, the morning after many hours of being stuck, using the good patterns preceeding myself, & documenting process along the way, reaching toward some ever unattainable perfection in software, or in anything.

So here is over a decade of code memories, old & new, available to execute on your own machine, or one(s) you rent, to help each other figure this all out, and hopefully make the world a better place for all humans, use it well, in love 🙏💜
